<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your application locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

Poetry requires Python 3.7+. It is multi-platform and the goal is to make it work equally well on Linux, macOS and Windows.

   ```
3. Install the application by command line
